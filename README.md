# Budget Tracker (Python Project)
## 1. Project Title
Budget Tracker – A command-line Python program for managing monthly expenses
## 2. Overview of the Project
- This project is a simple Budget Tracker made using Python.  
- The idea behind the project is to help users keep track of how much money they plan to spend in a month and how much they have already spent.  
- The user can set a monthly budget, add different expenses, view all saved entries, and check the remaining balance at any time.  
- The program runs in a loop and uses a simple text-based menu so that anyone can use it without difficulty.
- This project also serves as a good practice exercise for understanding basic Python concepts such as lists, dictionaries, loops, functions, and user input handling.
## 3. Features

## 4. Technologies / Tools Used
- Python 3 (core programming language)
- Built-in data types (lists and dictionaries)
- Basic terminal / command prompt
- Any text editor (VS Code, PyCharm, Notepad, etc.)

1. budget – stores the monthly budget entered by the user.  
2. expenses – a list that stores every expense as a dictionary.
 Instructions for Testing the Program

## 7.To properly test the program:
1. Run the program and *set a budget* (example: 5000).
2. Add a few expenses like:
   - vegetable–₹240
   - stationary–₹200
3. Use *View Expenses* to confirm that entries are stored correctly.
4. Use *Remaining Budget* and check:
   - Total spent is correct
   - Remaining amount is correct
5. Exit the program
