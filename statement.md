People often set a monthly budget but fail to keep track of how much they have already spent.  
Small daily expenses add up quickly, and without a basic system, it becomes difficult to know the remaining balance.

- and calculates the remaining balance.
The scope is limited to temporary data storage using lists.  
No database or file saving is included in this version.

## High-Level Features
